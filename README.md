### Research Project in the scope of ‘Deep Learning for Natural Language Processing (392197)’ at University of Bielefeld
#### by Moritz Altemeyer and Philipp Hege

-----------------------------

This repository contains the code of the project including its corresponding documentation. The repository can be divided into two main sections:

- Folder **BERT_metric**: Contains the whole BERT experiment: BERT as a evaluation metric vor natural language generation tested with adapters.

- Folder **comet_experiment**:  Contains the whole COMET experiment.
